### Table S2 
It contained the ABTS and ORAC activity of the 400 dipeptides and can be coordinated with R-PeptideCutter to generate the peptide with abundance and bioactivity.

### supplimentary documentary
Five hundred and fifty-three numerical indices of the 20 amino acids are shown in Supplementary Document 1. ABTS radical scavenging capacity and ORAC dataset are shown in Supplementary Document 2. Original Pearson correlation coefficients of the 553 numerical indices are listed in Supplementary Document 3, and the heatmap of the correlation coefficient is presented in Supplementary Document 4. The detailed python codes for model development are shown in Supplementary Document 5. The predicted antioxidant activity of the possible dipeptides (ABTS radical scavenging capacity & ORAC) is listed in Supplementary Document 6. The kafirin sequences (fasta format files) and a brief summary (Table S1), the used enzymes or chemical information (Table S2), and all possible kafirin-derived dipeptides with the enzyme information (Table S2), cleavage sites of enzymes and chemicals (Table S3), and R-PeptideCutter tool scripts are listed in Supplementary Document 7.
